%
%   additional outputs included in rmset output:
%
%   'map_pos'       -   [Nx2] Position data converted to match the firing rate map.
%                       Each row specifies an x,y coordinate and matches the order
%                       given by the pos input.
%
%   'map_spk'       -   [Nx2] Spike data converted to match the firing rate map.
%                       Each row specifies an x,y coordinate and matches the order
%                       given by the spk input.
%
%   'xgrid'         -   [1xN] Location of the firing rate map bin centers along the
%                       x-axis (i.e. the columns of the rate map)
%
%   'ygrid'         -   [1xN] Location of the firing rate map bin centers along the
%                       y-axis (i.e. the columns of the rate map)
%
%   'points_to_map' -   Anonymous function that can be used to convert x,y coordinates
%                       to match the maps. Example:
%                       mapXY = rmset.points_to_map(XY);
%                       where XY is an Nx2 set of input coordinates in the same reference
%                       frame as pos and spk, mapXY are the coordinates converted to
%                       the firing rate map reference frame. See example below.
%
%   Class Support
%   -------------
%   The input matrices pos and spk must be a real, non-sparse matrix of
%   the following classes: uint8, int8, uint16, int16, uint32, int32,
%   single or double.
%
%
%   Notes
%   -----
%   1. If cells are recorded in the same session their spikemaps are 
%      expected to differ while the position data and dwellmap will
%      remain the same. To save time this function can accept a precomputed 
%      output, skipping that computation (which is usually more time 
%      consuming than the spikemap). Simply provide the 'speedlift' output 
%      from rate_mapper to the next iteration of rate_mapper. For some 
%      methods a dwellmap is not computed or would not speed up 
%      computation if provided, so instead a matrix or similar form of 
%      data output is used instead. Thus in some cases (i.e. 'histogram' 
%      method) the speedlift matrix will be identical to the dwellmap, 
%      but in other cases (i.e. 'kadaptive') it will take a different 
%      form and contain different data.
%
%   2. For the 'histogram' method and smoothing method 1, smoothing is 
%      achieved using imgaussfilt. The FilterDomain is set to 'spatial'
%      to ensure convolution in the spatial domain. 'Padding' is set to 
%      a scalar value of 0 as there should be no position or spike data
%      in bins outside the map limits.
% 
%   2. For the 'histogram' method and smoothing method 2, smoothing is 
%      achieved using a Gaussian filter via nanconv with the 'nanout'
%      option. This will smooth the data while ignoring nans.
%
%
%   Example
%   ---------
%  % create dummy data and then generate a firing rate map
%     np = 1000; % number of position points to simulate
%     pos = rand(np,2)*1000; % simulate position data
%     spk = normrnd(500,100,ceil(np/10),2); % simulate spike data

% DESCRIPTION IN REF
% The X and Y positions are used as indices into a 64 x 64 time-in-location array and a 64 x 64 spikes-in-location array. The indexed
% element in the time array is incremented by 1; the same element in the spike array i incremented by the number of spikes fired during the 1/60th
% sec sample interval. This sequence is repeated for all the samples in the time series. A 64 x 64 rate array is then filed by dividing the time
% array into the spike array on an element-by-element basis. Unvisited pixels are marked by setting the appropriate element of the rate array to -1.

% SIMPLE DESCRIPTION            
% A bivariate histogram is generated for the position data and the spike data seperately. Firing rate in each pixel is then calculated by dividing
% the spike histogram by the position histogram multiplied by the sampling interval of the position data so that the final product is in units of Hz.
% The original papers did not include any smoothing, but these histograms are generally smoothed nowadays before the division occurs. This smoothing 
% is usually Gaussian but may also be an average/uniform boxcar kernel. Histograms are extremely fast to compute and combined with smoothing provide
% suprisingly accurate maps.

            % generate spikemap and dwellmap if necessary
            % coordinates are backwards so the resulting map has the correct orientation in IJ
            spikemap = histcounts2(spy,spx,yvec,xvec);

            % the dwellmap only needs to be computed if one wasn't provided
            if ~isempty(speedlift) && ~all(isnan(speedlift(:)))
                dwellmap = speedlift;

                    error(sprintf('Size of provided dwellmap (%s) does not match the expected size {%s)... exiting',mat2str(size(dwellmap)),mat2str(expected_size)));

% DESCRIPTION IN REF
% A simple device has been proposed for eliminating the bin edge problem of the frequency polygon while retaining many of the computational advantages of a density
% estimate based on bin counts. Scott (1983, 1985b) considered the problem of choosing among the collection of multivariate frequency polygons, each with the same
% smoothing parameter but differing bin origins. Rather than choosing the “smoothest” such curve or surface, he proposed averaging several of the shifted frequency polygons. 
% As the average of piecewise linear curves is also piecewise linear, the resulting curve appears to be a frequency polygon as well. If the weights are nonnegative and
% sum to 1, the resulting “averaged shifted frequency polygon” (ASFP) is nonnegative and integrates to 1. A nearly equivalent device is to average several shifted histograms, 
% which is just as general but simpler to describe and analyze. The result is the “averaged shifted histogram” (ASH). Since the average of piecewise constant functions such as the
% histogram is also piecewise constant, the ASH appears to be a histogram as well. In practice, the ASH is made continuous using either of the linear interpolation schemes
% described for the frequency polygon in Chapter 4, and will be referred to as the frequency polygon (FP) of the (ASH). The ASH is the practical choice for computationally 
% and statistically efficient density estimation. Algorithms for its evaluation are described in detail.

% SIMPLE DESCRIPTION            
% Histograms are very fast to compute, but kernel smoothed density estimates are more accurate, one tradeoff is to instead calculate a lot of different histograms with slightly 
% offset bins (i.e. the bin edges are moved with respect to the data by a fraction of 1 bin length). The result is a histogram with a much lower MISE than a single histogram.
% In practice the result should not need to be smoothed and an added benefit is that the resulting histograms still sum to the number of data points.
% In reality we don't make multiple histograms but instead make one very fine scale one and then use a special weighting kernel to average across them.

% To calculate the firing rate at a given point, a circle centered on the point is gradually expanded until the following criterion is met:

% where a is a constant, r is the radius of the circle in pixels, n is the number of 50-msec-long occupancy samples lying within the circle, and s is the
% total number of spikes contained in those occupancy samples. Once this criterion was met, the firing rate assigned to the point was equal to s/n.

% SIMPLE DESCRIPTION            
% There is no Ref for this method as I don't think it has been proposed before. This mixes the benefits and methods underlying both the average shifted histogram
% and adaptive binning. We create a fine grid (suggested is 1cm or less binsize) and bin the spike and position data into this, like we do with ASH
% Then we apply a kernel to this like the ASH but instead of weighting this to average over histograms we sum all the spikes and position data within a series of distances
% of each bin, like with the adaptive method. Then we apply the same formula as in the adaptive method to every bin, finding the radius for each that meets the criteria
% Because we bin the data into a fine grid before this process we don't have to compute distances which saves a lot of time and the kernel we use is very simple
% and can be applied using convolution methods for an overall very fast process which should approximate a KDE

% DESCRIPTION IN REF
% Spatial firing rate distributions (‘place fields’) for each wellisolated neuron were constructed in the standard manner by 
% summing the total number of spikes that occurred in a given location bin (5 by 5 cm), dividing by the amount of time that
% the animal spent in that location, and smoothing with a Gaussian centered on each bin. The average rate in each bin x was estimated as:
% [equation in paper]
% where g is a smoothing kernel, h is a smoothing factor, n is the number of spikes, si the location of the i-th spike, y(t) the location 
% of the rat at time t, and [0, T) the period of the recording. A Gaussian kernel was used for g and h = 5 cm. Positions more than 5 cm away 
% from the tracked path were regarded as unvisited.         

% SIMPLE DESCRIPTION
% For every bin we calculate the distance to every spike and every position data point. These distances are weighted with a gaussian so that
% data close to the bin centre = high and data far away = low. The sum of the spike distances are then divided by the sum of the position
% distances to obtain firing rate. The standard deviation of the gaussian can be changed, with a result similar to more smoothing in a standard
% firing rate map. For speed the effect of the gaussian can be clipped at config.maxdist, meaning we have to perform computations only
% on position data close to each bin

% DESCRIPTION IN REF for original method
% To characterize firing fields, we estimated a spike density function by convolving the
% spike train with a smoothing kernel and sampled this ‘signal’ synchronously with the
% tracker position. The kernel was a 2 s wide Blackman window normalized to have unit
% gain at zero frequency, which approximates a Gaussian kernel with 330 ms standard
% deviation. The reason for smoothing the rate map in the temporal dimension has to do
% with the low frequency of the tracker signal compared to the spike frequency. Our
% algorithm required the analog spike train to be discretized in synchrony with the video
% tracker (i.e. intervals at 20 ms). This necessitated the use of an anti-aliasing lowpass
% filter with substantial attenuation at 25 Hz (40 ms periods). After determining the firing
% rate for each tracker position, we calculated the spatially averaged firing rate for each
% location in a 5 × 5 cm grid centered above the open field. The average rates were
% estimated by weighted means of the sampled spike density function. The weights were
% Euclidian distance multiplied by a 30 cm wide Blackman window. In order to avoid
% error from extrapolation, we considered positions more than 5 cm away from the
% tracked path as unvisited.
